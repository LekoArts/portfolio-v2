You can leverage Gatsby's GraphQL data layer to filter blog posts that are in the future. This _TODAY_ variable allows you to e.g. build your site once a day and automatically have it published. A use case would be a podcast website where the author recorded the episode and already has written the description in advance. This way you also don't have to worry about remembering setting a "draft" variable or to be able to push changes up when you want something published.

**If you need a TL;DR:** You can visit the final example on [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/blogposts-in-future-field-4iuvp) (have a look at `gatsby-node.js` and the filtering in `src/pages/index.js`).

## Setup

Install [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) with Gatsby's CLI:

```sh
gatsby new my-blog-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
```

When starting the development server you'll see an overview of all posts on the index page. The end goal is to filter out all future posts from this list.

First, you should change the date on one post inside `content/blog` to a future date. In the linked Codesandbox the post `new-beginnings` was changed. You will still see all posts in the overview.

Stop the development server and install a function from [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) that you'll use in the next step:

```sh
npm install lodash.get
```

## Creating the extension

Open your `gatsby-node.js` file and add the installed package, and the boilerplate to use [Gatsby's schema customization API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/schema-customization/):

```js title=gatsby-node.js
const get = require("lodash.get");

exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({ actions }) => {
  const { createTypes, createFieldExtension } = actions;
};
```

With the function `createTypes` you'll explicitly define the GraphQL types (in this case in GraphQL [SDL](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-6755bcb9ce51) syntax), with `createFieldExtension` you'll create a so called directive/extension that you then can reuse throughout your types.

Since gatsby-starter-blog is powered by Markdown you'll want to add your `isFuture` field to the markdown type. It's called `MarkdownRemark` — you are probably used to querying that in GraphQL queries. Going to GraphiQL (`localhost:8000/___graphql`) and _Docs_ (top right corner) => _Query_ also reveals all available types.

Adding this type definition defines the mentioned field at the root of the Markdown type:

```js title=gatsby-node.js {6-10}
const get = require("lodash.get");

exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({ actions }) => {
  const { createTypes, createFieldExtension } = actions;

  createTypes(`
    type MarkdownRemark implements Node {
      isFuture: Boolean!
    }
  `);
};
```

The notation `Boolean!` means that the field is of type Boolean and is Non-Nullable.

### Creating the helper function

In the next step you'll create the helper function that returns either true or false depending on whether the input date is in the future or not.

```js title=gatsby-node.js {6-9}
const get = require("lodash.get");

exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({ actions }) => {
  const { createTypes, createFieldExtension } = actions;

  const isFuture = (fieldName) => (source) => {
    const date = get(source, fieldName);
    return new Date(date) > new Date();
  };

  createTypes(`
    type MarkdownRemark implements Node {
      isFuture: Boolean!
    }
  `);
};
```

The concept used there is called [Currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying). For this example it means:

If you run `isFuture("myName")` you'll receive a function:

```js
(source) => {
  const date = get(source, "myName");
  return new Date(date) > new Date();
};
```

So what is that function doing? With the `lodash.get` function you're able to input a string with only one word (e.g. _myName_) or a word with dot notation (e.g. _myName.field_). The latter is used to access information in objects. The `lodash.get` function translates the string and enables you to access that information. If you later `console.log(source)` you'll see that you have access to `source.frontmatter` and other fields. It then checks the date with the current date and returns true if it's in the future, otherwise false.

Next, use `createFieldExtension` and the just created `isFuture` function:

```js title=gatsby-node.js {11-21}
const get = require("lodash.get");

exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({ actions }) => {
  const { createTypes, createFieldExtension } = actions;

  const isFuture = (fieldName) => (source) => {
    const date = get(source, fieldName);
    return new Date(date) > new Date();
  };

  createFieldExtension({
    name: "isFuture",
    args: {
      fieldName: "String!",
    },
    extend({ fieldName }) {
      return {
        resolve: isFuture(fieldName),
      };
    },
  });

  createTypes(`
    type MarkdownRemark implements Node {
      isFuture: Boolean!
    }
  `);
};
```

`createFieldExtension` accepts three arguments. `name` will be name of the directive, `args` the information you can give it and `extend` is a function that has to return a (partial) field config. In more verbose terms (including `isFuture`) you could write it like this:

```js
const isFuture = (fieldName, source) => {
  const date = get(source, fieldName);
  return new Date(date) > new Date();
};

createFieldExtension({
  name: "isFuture",
  args: {
    fieldName: "String!",
  },
  extend(options) {
    return {
      resolve(source) {
        return isFuture(options.fieldName, source);
      },
    };
  },
});
```

So the the code you'll be using is destructuring the `options` and passing `source` via _Currying_ to `isFuture`.

After adding the field extension to the field, the final code should look like:

```js title=gatsby-node.js {25}
const get = require("lodash.get");

exports.createSchemaCustomization = ({ actions }) => {
  const { createTypes, createFieldExtension } = actions;

  const isFuture = (fieldName) => (source) => {
    const date = get(source, fieldName);
    return new Date(date) > new Date();
  };

  createFieldExtension({
    name: "isFuture",
    args: {
      fieldName: "String!",
    },
    extend({ fieldName }) {
      return {
        resolve: isFuture(fieldName),
      };
    },
  });

  createTypes(`
    type MarkdownRemark implements Node {
      isFuture: Boolean! @isFuture(fieldName: "frontmatter.date")
    }
  `);
};
```

As the date is defined in the frontmatter the fieldName is `frontmatter.date`. If you would place the `isFuture` field in the frontmatter itself you would use only `date` for the `fieldName`.

Start the development server, head to GraphiQL and see that you now can query `isFuture` on `MarkdownRemark` nodes!

You now can filter `allMarkdownRemark` with `filter: { isFuture: { eq: false } }` to hide posts. See an example on [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/blogposts-in-future-field-4iuvp).

## Where to go from here

Congrats, you just created a generic field extension that allows you to generate a `isFuture` field! You can not only use that with Markdown files but with any type in the GraphQL schema.

Lookup the type you want to modify in GraphiQL and add the `isFuture` field where appropriate. If you're unsure what value you have to pass into `fieldName`, you can inspect the passed `source` and see what's available.
