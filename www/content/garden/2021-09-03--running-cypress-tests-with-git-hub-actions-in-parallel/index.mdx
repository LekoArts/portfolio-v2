Here's a quick explanation and example of how you can run multiple Cypress tests in parallel using GitHub Action's `matrix` feature and **without** the need to use Cypress Dashboard.

If you want to see a real-world application using this pattern, you can checkout my [gatsby-themes repository](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/blob/21ecb07e827de50f8ae02ae041cd569ab948b857/.github/workflows/e2e_testing.yml).

## Prerequisites

Let's say you use _Create React App_ (CRA) and have a small list of E2E tests that you want to run inside `cypress/integration`:

```
cypress/
├─ integration/
│  ├─ homepage.js
│  ├─ contact-form.js
│  ├─ seo.js
```

In order to run the tests you'll need to build the CRA app, [serve the app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment), and only then start Cypress.

## GitHub Action Workflow

Set up the the workflow file and add the two jobs you need:

```yaml title=.github/workflows/e2e_testing.yml
name: E2E Testing
on: pull_request
jobs:
  install:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  e2e_tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: install
    container: cypress/browsers:node14.17.0-chrome91-ff89
```

You can adjust the `on` trigger to your needs and change the `container` (at the time of writing this it was the latest LTS image).

Add the necessary checkout, Cypress action and build steps to the workflow:

```yaml title=.github/workflows/e2e_testing.yml {6-20,25-32}
name: E2E Testing
on: pull_request
jobs:
  install:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2
        with:
          runTests: false
      - name: Run CRA Build
        run: yarn build
      - name: Save Cypress artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: build
          if-no-files-found: error
          path: build
  e2e_tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: install
    container: cypress/browsers:node14.17.0-chrome91-ff89
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Download Cypress artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: build
          path: build
```

The `cypress-io/github-action@v2` action sets up Cypress, installs dependencies and caches them between runs. In the `install` step it uses `runTests: false` since you only want to set up the container, not run tests just yet. With `actions/upload-artifact@v2` the output of CRA build is saved for the `e2e_tests` runs.

In this last step you use the [`matrix` feature](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix) to tell `cypress-io/github-action@v2` to run each of your tests in parallel. This does not use the `parallel` option of the action itself but defines the `spec` through the `matrix` itself. The entries in the `matrix.containers` are the names of your files inside `cypress/integration`.

Here's the complete workflow file:

```yaml title=.github/workflows/e2e_testing.yml {25-28,37-44}
name: E2E Testing
on: pull_request
jobs:
  install:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2
        with:
          runTests: false
      - name: Run CRA Build
        run: yarn build
      - name: Save Cypress artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: build
          if-no-files-found: error
          path: build
  e2e_tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: install
    container: cypress/browsers:node14.17.0-chrome91-ff89
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        containers: [homepage, contact-form, seo]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Download Cypress artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: build
          path: build
      - name: Cypress Test
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2
        with:
          spec: cypress/integration/${{ matrix.containers }}.js
          browser: chrome
          start: yarn start
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
