Prismic is a hosted, proprietary Headless CMS (SaaS) with a web app for creating and publishing content. It's suitable for marketers, editors and developers as it has both a "Writing Room", and a fully-fledged API & content backend. Besides the usual advantages of a SaaS CMS (hosting, security, updates) Prismic offers features like: custom type builder, scheduling and content versioning and multi-language support.

Now I created a Gatsby Starter for Prismic: [gatsby-starter-prismic](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-prismic). You can see a preview here: [prismic.lekoarts.de](https://prismic.lekoarts.de/)

The starter uses many features of Prismic, such as:

- Slices
- Labels
- Relationship Fields
- Single/Repeatable Custom Type

Visit the GitHub repository to see the complete feature list and instructions on how to set up this starter. Have fun!
