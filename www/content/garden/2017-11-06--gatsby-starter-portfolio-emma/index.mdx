```sh
gatsby new project-name https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-portfolio-emma
```

2. **Start developing.**

Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up.

```sh
cd project-name
gatsby develop
```

3. **Open the code and start customizing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

If you want to learn more about how you can use a Gatsby starter that is configured with a Gatsby theme, you can checkout this [shorter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/using-a-gatsby-theme/) or [longer](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/using-a-theme/) tutorial. The tutorials don't exactly apply to this starter however the concepts are the same.

## Using and modifying this starter

**Important Note:** Please read the guide [Shadowing in Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/) to understand how to customize the underlying theme!

This starter creates a new Gatsby site that installs and configures the theme [`@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-emma`](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-emma).

Have a look at the theme's README and files to see what options are available and how you can shadow the various components including Theme UI. Generally speaking you will want to place your files into `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-emma/` to shadow/override files. The Theme UI config can be configured by shadowing its files in `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/`.
