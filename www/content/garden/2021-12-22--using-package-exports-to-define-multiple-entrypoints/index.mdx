At work I was recently faced with this error and I was a bit clueless at first what it could be:

```shell
ModuleParseError: Module parse failed: Unexpected character ''
```

A colleague mentioned that they also have seen it while doing some work on ES Modules (ESM). So what was the cause of this error and how did I solve it? TL;DR: Use `exports` in `package.json`.

## Setup

So in short, the setup was as following:

- Package `frontend` imported a helper function from package `utils`. `frontend` is used in client-side code, e.g. React
- Package `utils` contains a couple of helper functions, both with and without 3rd-party dependencies. It is written in TypeScript and the output is compiled into a `dist` folder at the root of the package.
- `webpack` is used for `frontend` to bundle all code

The file inside `frontend` imports it like this:

```js title=frontend/src/link.js
import { convertPath } from "utils"

export const linkHelper = (input) => {
  return convertPath(input)
}
```

The `utils` package contains multiple files, for example two files:

```ts title=utils/src/convert-path.ts
export const convertPath = (path: string) => path.toUpperCase()
```

```ts title=utils/src/watch.ts
import * as path from "path"
import * as chokidar from "chokidar"

export const getDirname = (path: string) => path.dirname(path)
export const watchDir = (path: string, glob: string) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    chokidar.watch(glob, { cwd: path }).on("ready", () => resolve())
  })
}
```

Those get exported in an `index.ts` file:

```ts title=utils/src/index.ts
export { convertPath } from "./path"
export { getDirname, watchDir } from "./watch"
```

And referenced in the `main` field of `package.json` with `"main": "dist/index.js"`.

## Solution

The problem with this setup is that `webpack` (or probably any other bundler) has problems tree-shaking the Node.js and `chokidar` bits from `utils` when you only import `convertPath` in the `frontend` package. This is why one sees the error mentioned at the beginning.

But ESM and/or `exports` in `package.json` can come to the rescue here! Node.js itself has extensive documentation about [Package entry points](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#package-entry-points) so for the sake of this small post here's just the solution on how to fix the problem for the given example.

First, add the `exports` to utils:

```json title=utils/package.json
"exports": {
  ".": "./dist/index.js",
  "./*": "./dist/*.js"
}
```

This enables the change in this second step:

```js title=frontend/src/link.js {1}
import { convertPath } from "utils/convert-path"

export const linkHelper = (input) => {
  return convertPath(input)
}
```

Notice the different import for `convertPath`? This is a new entrypoint you can use the ignore all the stuff that you don't need. Awesome!
