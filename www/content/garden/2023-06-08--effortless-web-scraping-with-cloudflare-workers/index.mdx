Some time ago I had the need to grab information from a website to display some visitor numbers onto a widget powered by [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app/). Unfortunately, that website didn't have an API for its numbers, it only displayed it in a table on the website. This is where a web scraper is needed.

There are endless ways and articles about web scrapers, so I want to share a little tool I used for that job. I do like it because: It's easy to use, fast, and free. All you need is an account at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

The tool I want to highlight is [web.scraper.workers.dev](https://web.scraper.workers.dev/) by [Adam Schwartz](https://adamschwartz.co/). Give it a URL and a CSS selector and you're done! If the website ever goes down, you can grab the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/adamschwartz/web.scraper.workers.dev) and host it yourself.

If for example you'd use the URL `example.com` and the CSS selector `h1` you'd get the result:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "h1": [
      "Example Domain"
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also generate a permalink to it:

```
https://web.scraper.workers.dev/?url=example.com&selector=h1&scrape=text&pretty=true
```

I'm now using such a permalink as my API for those website numbers. I find using Cloudflare Workers for web scraping to be quite approachable and Adam's tool makes it even easier.

Oh, and in case you're wondering how I use the table data, here's a small code playground to show it:

  const bulks: Array<Array<string>> = []
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.ceil(arr.length / size); i++) {
    bulks.push(arr.slice(i * size, (i + 1) * size))

  return bulks

  const arr = input.split(" ")
  const columns = arr.slice(0, size).map((i) => ({ heading: i, property: i.toLowerCase() }))

  const chunkedData = chunk(rawData)
  const data = chunkedData.map((item) => ({
    name: item[0],
