For me personally [Figma](https://www.figma.com) was certainly **the tool** that changed my webdesign workflow the most, and for the better. Coming from Photoshop it's the much better tool for the job and it also enabled me way quicker to write plugins for it. If you know HTML, CSS, and JS you can write a Figma plugin! The [Figma Developers documentation](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/intro/) explain the fundamentals about Figma plugins and also how you can e.g. create one with React. However, in this tutorial you'll (potentially) step out of your comfort zone and use Svelte, TypeScript, and Rollup to write a plugin for Figma.
