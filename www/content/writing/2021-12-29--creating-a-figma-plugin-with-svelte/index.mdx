## Introduction

For me personally [Figma](https://www.figma.com) was certainly **the tool** that changed my webdesign workflow the most, and for the better. Coming from Photoshop it's the much better tool for the job and it also enabled me way quicker to write plugins for it. If you know HTML, CSS, and JS you can write a Figma plugin! The [Figma Developers documentation](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/intro/) explains the fundamentals about Figma plugins and also how you can e.g. create one with React. However, in this tutorial you'll (potentially) step out of your comfort zone and learn how to use Svelte, TypeScript, and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) to write a plugin for Figma.

The popularity of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is rising and more and more people enjoy writing smaller to bigger apps with it. So it's certainly good to have it in your toolbelt and to have some familarity with it. Coming from React I most enjoyed the "simplicity" to some aspects of writing code in Svelte, as where React felt really verbose and clunky in comparison. Another thing you'll learn to appreciate is the output and speed of Svelte apps. Lastly, why should you care about Figma? Well, it's a super popular tool amongst individuals and larger teams -- and super extensible with plugins.

Here's what you'll build. You can pull a random image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) in the given size:

The finished project is available on GitHub at [figma-plugin-svelte-example](https://github.com/LekoArts/figma-plugin-svelte-example). You can also use this as a template for your next project.

If you want to follow this tutorial step-by-step you'll need to have a Figma Account ([Sign Up for an account](https://www.figma.com/signup)) and the desktop app installed ([download](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)).

## Conceptual Guide

Here's what you'll use and build explained on a higher level as a short summary:

1. Inside Figma initialize a new plugin to create the necessary files
1. Add dependencies like Svelte, Rollup, TypeScript, and [Figma Plugin DS Svelte](https://github.com/thomas-lowry/figma-plugin-ds-svelte) to build the app
1. Use the Figma Plugin DS Svelte UI kit to build out the UI
1. Leverage the browser `fetch` API to pull a random image from Unsplash and place it onto the current Figma frame

## Setup Guide

### Initializing a Plugin

Open the Figma desktop app and if you haven't already log into your account. Create a new design file in your drafts as you'll use this as a testground for the plugin. Once you have the design file open, go to _Menu => Plugins => Development => New Plugin..._.

First, it'll ask for a name and whether you want to create a "Figma design + Figjam" or "Figma design" plugin. Choose "Figma Design". In the next step, choose the "Empty" template. The "Save As" dialogue asks you for a directory where you want to create the project. Figma will create a folder with the given name inside your provided folder. Once that's done you should see a `code.js` and `manifest.json` file inside the newly created folder. Delete the `code.js` file, it'll be autogenerated later.

The `manifest.json` will contain something like this:

```json title=manifest.json
{
  "name": "your-name",
  "id": "1234567890123456789",
  "api": "1.0.0",
  "main": "code.js",
  "editorType": ["figma"]
}
```

You can learn more about the `manifest.json` file in the [Figma Plugin Manifest documentation](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/) but in a nutshell: This is the file with the plugin's unique ID (assigned during the _New Plugin..._ flow) and settings regarding the plugin. `main` points to the JavaScript code of our plugin. `ui` specifies the HTML file used in the iframe modal.

Add a new key called `ui` to `manifest.json` and change the location of `main`:

```json title=manifest.json {5-6}
{
  "name": "your-name",
  "id": "1234567890123456789",
  "api": "1.0.0",
  "main": "dist/code.js",
  "ui": "dist/ui.html",
  "editorType": ["figma"]
}
```

Since you'll be using TypeScript to write the source files and Rollup to compile the files into a `dist` folder, the `manifest.json` now points to the (soon to be) compiled files.

### Adding Dependencies

Initialize a new `package.json` with `npm init -y` and add the following dependencies (use the "Copy" button for easier installation):

```shell
npm install @figma/plugin-typings @rollup/plugin-commonjs @rollup/plugin-html @rollup/plugin-node-resolve @rollup/plugin-typescript cssnano figma-plugin-ds-svelte postcss rollup rollup-plugin-postcss rollup-plugin-svelte rollup-plugin-svg rollup-plugin-terser svelte tslib typescript
```

Also, create a `.gitignore` will the following contents:

```text title=.gitignore
node_modules
dist
.cache
```

Since you'll use TypeScript a `tsconfig.json` for the compiler is necessary. You can use this configuration:

```json title=tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "importsNotUsedAsValues": "error",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "typeRoots": ["./node_modules/@types", "./node_modules/@figma"]
  },
  "include": ["./src/**/*"]
}
```

Lastly, add `scripts` to your `package.json` to compile files on the fly in development mode and for production when you want to publish:

```json title=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rollup -c",
    "dev": "rollup -c -w",
    "clean": "rm -rf dist",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"
  }
}
```

### Compiling files

In these next steps you'll create the source files that will be compiled by Rollup and the configuration for Rollup itself.

Start by creating a directory called `src` and create three files in this directory: `code.ts`, `main.ts`, and `App.svelte`.

The `code.ts` will be responsible for creating the iframe and listening for messages. For now it only needs to contain this:

```ts title=src/code.ts
figma.showUI(__html__, { width: 320, height: 220 })
```

In order to load `App.svelte` the `main.ts` file sets up the app onto the `document.body`:

```ts title=src/main.ts
import "svelte"
import App from "./App.svelte"

const app = new App({
  target: document.body,
})

export default app
```

And now you can write Svelte code! Start with -- of course ðŸ˜‰ -- a "Hello World":

```svelte title=src/App.svelte
<div>Hello World</div>
```

The last missing piece to this is `rollup.config.js`. It'll define how these three source files are bundled into something that Figma can work with:

```js title=rollup.config.js
import resolve from "@rollup/plugin-node-resolve"
import commonjs from "@rollup/plugin-commonjs"
import typescript from "@rollup/plugin-typescript"
import html from "@rollup/plugin-html"
import svelte from "rollup-plugin-svelte"
import { terser } from "rollup-plugin-terser"
import svg from "rollup-plugin-svg"
import postcss from "rollup-plugin-postcss"
import cssnano from "cssnano"

const production = !process.env.ROLLUP_WATCH

/**
 * @type {import('rollup').RollupOptions}
 */
const mainConfig = {
  input: `src/main.ts`,
  output: {
    format: `iife`,
    name: `ui`,
    file: `dist/bundle.js`,
  },
  plugins: [
    typescript(),
    svelte({
      compilerOptions: {
        dev: !production,
      },
    }),
    resolve({
      browser: true,
      dedupe: (importee) =>
        importee === `svelte` || importee.startsWith(`svelte/`),
    }),
    commonjs(),
    svg(),
    postcss({
      extensions: [`.css`],
      plugins: [cssnano()],
    }),
    html({
      fileName: `ui.html`,
      template({ bundle }) {
        return `
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Your Name</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>${bundle[`bundle.js`].code}</script>
  </body>
</html>
        `
      },
    }),
    production && terser(),
  ],
  watch: {
    clearScreen: false,
  },
}

/**
 * @type {import('rollup').RollupOptions}
 */
const codeConfig = {
  input: `src/code.ts`,
  output: {
    file: `dist/code.js`,
    format: `cjs`,
    name: `code`,
  },
  plugins: [
    typescript(),
    commonjs(),
    resolve({
      browser: true,
    }),
    production && terser(),
  ],
}

const config = [mainConfig, codeConfig]

export default config
```
