# Design

While I began doing UI & webdesign with Photoshop I'm now primarily using Figma to create my designs. I enjoy creating minimalistic designs with strong typography, a lot of whitespace and emphasis on a couple of vibrant colors. From time to time I switch to creating whimsical designs that incorporate other disciplines I'm proficient in such as 3D art and illustration. I still stick to Photoshop when I create compositings â€“ to me the most rewarding craft as it's about stitching multiple photos together to a coherent image.
