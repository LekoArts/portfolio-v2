# Photography

Whenever I can I combine my love for hiking with photography. And often times it pushes me further by reaching higher mountains, waking up earlier, and exploring nature more. I primarily shoot landscape photography with occasional street photography.

I currently use a FujiFilm X-T100 together with these lenses:

- XF16-80mm F4 R OIS WR (When I need flexibility both in the city & landscape)
- XF16mm F2.8 R WR (My favourite lens to shoot landscape)
- XF35mm F2 R WR (Default lens)

I love the color science and look of FujiFilm! I process all images with Capture One. Below you can find the favourite photos from my trips.
