# Photography

Whenever I can I combine my love for hiking with photography. And often times it pushes me further by reaching higher mountains, waking up earlier, and exploring nature more. I primarily shoot landscape photography with occasional street photography.

I'm using FujiFilm cameras and lenses. My [Uses page](/uses) has more details.

I love the color science and look of FujiFilm! I process all images with Capture One. Below you can find the favourite photos from my trips.
