# 3D Art

Over the years I taught myself how to create 3D art with various tools, with my primary software being Cinema4D. I use Arnold as a renderer and most of the time post-process my images with Photoshop. I'm really grateful that I was able to learn everything with free YouTube videos created by many cool humans!
