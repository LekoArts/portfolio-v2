**Hi, I'm Lennart ðŸ‘‹**<br /><br />
I'm a designer turned software engineer from Darmstadt, Germany. I currently work at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) in the "Frameworks" team.
I'm passionate about working on open source projects & making the web more inclusive through them.<br />
My [OSS code](https://github.com/LekoArts) has been used by thousands of people & I regularly share educational content in the form of [posts](/writing), [presentations](/appearances), and [videos](/appearances).

## What I'm passionate about

Similarly to how I learned everything about [design, 3D art, and photography](/art) I'm a self-taught developer. Online developer communities, OSS projects, educators sharing their knowledge (for free & paid), mentors, colleagues, and friends â€“ all those people helped me get to where I am today. And I'm very grateful for that. Early on I also helped out people, contributed to OSS projects and published my own projects on GitHub. That's how I realized that I enjoy technical writing (e.g. public facing documentation), creating educational content and managing & interacting with communities. I deeply care about inclusivity & accessibility both in the communication with people and the content (e.g. website/documentation) itself.

## Work

I work at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) in the "Frameworks" team. Our job is to make every framework seamlessly work on Netlify. Through Netlify's acquisition of Gatsby I'm continuing to maintain the [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) framework. Together with my colleagues I implement bug fixes, performance improvements, new features, and review issues & PRs to help >300k users build websites.

You can see my [projects](/projects) overview for more technical details.

## Hobbies

If I'm not coding I like to spend my time with playing tennis & hiking in the mountains. I then often take my camera with me to take [landscape photos](/art/photography) and also particularly enjoy editing the photos at the computer afterwards. I also enjoy creating other forms of [art](/art) such as 3D art or UI design. Lastly, my kindle is always filled with fantasy & sci-fi books ðŸ“š.

## Bio: Short version

Lennart is a designer turned software engineer who is passionate about working on open source projects & making the web more inclusive through them. In the past Lennart has worked on Gatsby and his own open source projects with a particular focus on DX and documentation. When away from the keyboard, Lennart can be found hiking in the mountains, doing landscape photography, or reading fantasy & sci-fi books.
