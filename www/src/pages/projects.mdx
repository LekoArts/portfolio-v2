# Projects

Throughout the years I worked on multiple features, projects, and problems. I've lead features from start to finish, being the team lead and responsible person for those projects. I'm a strong communicator and have expertise in recognizing user needs, technical writing, and coordinating said projects across teams in an organization.

## Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a 100% remote, fully distributed company. Come back later to see what I work on at Netlify!

## Gatsby

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is a 100% remote, fully distributed company. It is responsible for the [Gatsby open source framework](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) and its Gatsby Cloud platform. At Gatsby is was responsible for maintining and improving the open source framework, but really wore a lot of hats. Besides the things you'd expect from maintaining a popular open source framework, I created a lot of content (docs, talks, blog posts, etc.), coordinated community efforts, and spoke with other partners and open source project authors.

In February 2023 [Gatsby joined Netlify](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/gatsby-is-joining-netlify/).

### Gatsby 5 release

For the Gatsby 5 release I took a huge portion of the organization work while documenting each process in written form for future major releases. I coordinated: Correct publish of beta & stable docs, cross-team docs updates, cross-team work for e.g. relevant third-party repositories, write the migration guide. I was also able to find time to integrate a new [version of GraphiQL](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v5.0/#graphiql-v2) into the release. Overall, the release was a great success as it was the easiest migration yet, and we saw quick adoption.

### Partial Hydration

One of the major new features for Gatsby 5 was Partial Hydration. Even though I oversaw this feature, it really was a team-effort as many moving pieces inside Gatsby had to be changed and at the time React Server Components were still quite experimental and no documentation existed. But with the deadline of Gatsby 5 release a [beta version](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v5.0/#partial-hydration-beta) could be shipped, alongside great documentation like a [how-to](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/performance/partial-hydration/) and [conceptual guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/partial-hydration/) (both authored by me). Partial Hydration itself allows a user to ship less JavaScript to the user's browser, improving frontend performance especially on weaker devices/connections.

### MDX 2

At the time the necessity for this project came up I was quite busy with [Partial Hydration](#partial-hydration) so we decided to use a contractor for this project under my guidance. So I was responsible for communication (internally & externally), creating a tech spec, and eventually seeing the feature shipped. Throughout the development of this rewrite, I leveraged the [umbrella discussion](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/25068) to get beta testers and feedback. The [results](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.21/#gatsby-plugin-mdx-v4) of the project were great: Full compatibility with latest MDX version, better tree-shaking support, simplified usage and plugin options, better customizability.

### GraphQL Typegen

Continuing on the path of improving Gatsby's TypeScript features, one of the last bigger missing pieces was the automatic generation of TypeScript types out of GraphQL queries. A user plugin was already doing this but we wanted to bring this to Gatsby's core for better maintenance and improved feature set. I've spoken with the author of the user plugin and discussed the current state of the plugin. As with every bigger feature, I created a [public RFC](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/35420) to inform the community and get input on their desired features. At the same time I was already prototyping a solution that we then shipped behind [a feature flag](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.14/#experimental-graphql-typegen). This incremental rollout allowed me to fix some further bugs before the [official release](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/local-development/graphql-typegen/). As a result, Gatsby users now don't have to manually write out TypeScript types for GraphQL queries, greatly reducing the time it takes to create typesafe Gatsby apps.

### Extended TypeScript support

As an avid TypeScript user myself I was eager for this project. The goal was to greatly improve Gatsby's TypeScript capabilities and support. After successfully onboarding my new colleagues (see [Trailing Slash](#trailing-slash)) I was able to coordinate this initiative on multiple fronts: [Support in gatsby-browser/gatsby-ssr](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.8/#support-for-typescript-in-gatsby-browser-and-gatsby-ssr), [CLI TypeScript option](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.8/#new-typescript-option-when-creating-gatsby-projects-from-the-cli), [Support in gatsby-config/gatsby-node](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.9/#support-for-typescript-in-gatsby-config-and-gatsby-node). For the added TypeScript support in `gatsby-config` & `gatsby-node` I first looked into viable options through a [public RFC](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/34613) and eventually landed on [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). I've contributed upstreams PRs to Parcel to have all the necessary features we'd need for Gatsby's use case and established a great working relationship with Parcel folks while doing that. In the end, the result was a quick ahead-of-time compilation of TypeScript files and happy users and enterprise customers. They especially liked the improved speed and memory footprint since previous workarounds like `ts-node` consumed a lot of memory.

### Trailing Slash

Historically speaking the handling of trailing slash behavior in Gatsby was difficult as no official, singular option existed. So I set out to change that and led this feature from start to finish. First, I co-authored the [RFC](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/34205) to receive community feedback and see if the API that was inspired by SvelteKit appealed to our users. At the same time as this project started my team also got two new team members which I promptly onboarded onto that project. The result of this collaboration was a [simple to use](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/#trailingslash) API that quickly gained user adoption.

### Gatsby 4 release

The fourth major release of the Gatsby open source framework was a massive cross-team collaboration since it introduced multiple new features (see [v4 release notes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.0/)). I authored the majority of the [migration guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v3-to-v4/), wrote guides ([rendering options](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/rendering-options/), [DSG](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/rendering-options/using-deferred-static-generation/), [SSR](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/rendering-options/using-server-side-rendering/)), and handled the breaking changes for Gatsby 4.

Leading up to the Gatsby 4 release I contributed core parts to the [Parallel Query Running (PQR) feature](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.0/#parallel-query-running) which reduced Gatsby build times by up to 40%. I used Gatsby's LMDB feature to share state across worker threads, spin up query running for each available core, and combine the results of each worker at the end again. While working on this feature I both internally and externally created documentation explaining the architecture.

Part of this work also flowed into the [talk I gave about PQR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3haR60VjZc).

### Fast Refresh integration

[Fast Refresh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-refresh) is an implementation of Hot Reloading with full support from React. As the project lead I had to ensure that it was integrated with a new overlay into Gatsby. The end result is a responsive, helpful, and accessible modal (with focus trap, correct aria labels, respects `prefers-*` media queries) showing multiple types of errors. In addition, a public facing [Fast Refresh documentation page](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/local-development/fast-refresh/) was written to inform users of how it works, limitations, and tips. Through user interviews it became clear that this improved error overlay greatly reduced the time it took users to fix their errors on their own.

This feature was also part of the Gatsby 3 release which I [gave a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO-5qFa_hH8) about.

### File System Route API

Gatsby's [File System Route API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/) is one of Gatsby's core features. During its beta phase I was a core contributor to the project, for the official release I took over the lead of the project. As it was a brand new feature, it required coordination across departments and things like documentation, tutorials, extensive testing, user research, and fixing edge cases. It greatly improved the DX of Gatsby and lowered the level of entry for each user. It is now the default and recommended way of creating pages in Gatsby, featured in e.g. the [main tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-6/).

### Internalization themes

As lead engineer on the Gatsby internalization (i18n) initiative, I knew right from the start that internationalization and localization are multi-faceted problems requiring an iterative solution process with involvement from the community. I started researching the current i18n ecosystem in Gatsby. I published the article [Research on i18n with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2020-07-13-i18n-pain-points/) to invite people to give feedback and work together on the identified pain points. The announcement article [Gatsby Goes Global: Announcing Gatsby’s Official i18n Theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2020-07-28-introducing-gatsby-i18n-theme/) lays out the problems I hit and the solutions I found for integrating third-party libraries together with Gatsby. The users are now able to combine the main theme with a theme of their choice to have instant support for most common i18n use cases.

### Gatsby themes

Partially during work time, partially in my free time I started creating [free & open source Gatsby Themes](https://themes.lekoarts.de/) that are still very popular with Gatsby users. Most of them are portfolio or blog sites, with a focus on minimalism and excellent accessiblity. They are a great way for me to test out new Gatsby features in the wild, connect with community needs, and subsequently improve the Gatsby framework.
