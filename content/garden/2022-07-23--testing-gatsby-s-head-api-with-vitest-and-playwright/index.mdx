With Gatsby's [4.19 release](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v4.19/) a new API was added: [Gatsby Head API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-head/). Gatsby includes a built-in Head export that allows you to add elements to the document head of your pages.

In this short post I want to explain how to unit test and end to end (E2E) test components that you use with Gatsby Head API. The examples will use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

If you want to follow along, make sure that you have a SEO component first. You can follow the official [Adding an SEO component guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/adding-common-features/adding-seo-component) to learn how to create one.

You can find the complete project used for these examples on GitHub: [testing-gatsby-head-api](https://github.com/LekoArts/testing-gatsby-head-api)

## Unit Testing with Vitest

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install -D @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react c8 jsdom vitest
```

Create a `vitest.config.ts`:

```ts title=vitest.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config"

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    globals: true,
    setupFiles: `./vitest-setup.ts`,
    include: [`src/**/__tests__/*.{ts,tsx}`],
    coverage: {
      reporter: [`text`, `json`, `html`],
    },
  },
})
```

Create a `vitest-setup.ts` file:

```ts title=vitest-setup.ts
import { vi } from "vitest"
import React from "react"
import "@testing-library/jest-dom"

vi.mock(`gatsby`, async () => {
  const gatsby = await vi.importActual<typeof import("gatsby")>(`gatsby`)

  return {
    ...gatsby,
    graphql: vi.fn(),
    Link: vi.fn().mockImplementation(({ to, ...rest }) =>
      React.createElement(`a`, {
        ...rest,
        href: to,
      })
    ),
    StaticQuery: vi.fn(),
    useStaticQuery: vi.fn(),
  }
})
```

Add scripts to `package.json`:

```json title=package.json
"test:watch": "vitest watch",
"test:ci": "vitest run",
"test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
```

If you followed the [Adding an SEO component guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/adding-common-features/adding-seo-component) you'll have a `<SEO />` component at `src/components/seo` that has a bunch of props and uses a custom React hook to fetch data from `siteMetadata`. You'll need to mock the usage of `useStaticQuery` in your test file to be able to render it with `@testing-library/react`.

Here's an example test file for an SEO component:

```ts title=src/components/__tests__/seo.tsx
/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 */

import * as React from "react"
import * as Gatsby from "gatsby"
import { render } from "@testing-library/react"
import { vi } from "vitest"
import { SEO } from "../seo"

const useStaticQuery = vi.spyOn(Gatsby, `useStaticQuery`)
const mockUseStaticQuery = {
  site: {
    siteMetadata: {
      siteTitle: `Testing Gatsby Head API`,
      siteUrl: `https://www.yourdomain.tld`,
      siteDescription: `Showing how to test Gatsby Head API with Vitest and Playwright`,
    },
  },
}

describe(`SEO component`, () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    useStaticQuery.mockImplementation(() => mockUseStaticQuery)
  })

  afterEach(() => {
    vi.restoreAllMocks()
  })

  it(`should have sensible defaults`, () => {
    const result = render(<SEO />, { container: document.head }).baseElement
      .parentElement?.firstChild

    expect(result).toMatchInlineSnapshot()
  })
  it(`should accept all common props`, () => {
    const result = render(
      <SEO
        title="Custom Title"
        description="Custom Description"
        pathname="/custom-path"
      />,
      { container: document.head }
    ).baseElement.parentElement?.firstChild

    expect(result).toMatchInlineSnapshot()
  })
})
```

The `.baseElement.parentElement?.firstChild` is quite important here to get the correct element to look at. Without it the result from `render()` is just too verbose.

Run Vitest to fill the inline snapshots. Your tests should pass.

```sh
npm run test:ci
```

## E2E Testing with Playwright

Install Playwright using their CLI:

```sh
npm init playwright@latest
```

Choose `e2e` as your folder name and don't install any GitHub actions (unless you know you need them).

Once installation is done, add the following scripts to `package.json`:

```json title=package.json
"playwright": "playwright test",
"playwright:debug": "playwright test --debug",
"playwright:init": "playwright install chromium",
```

While the initial installation added more devices than only `chromium`, I'm only interested in using Chromium. And when you clone the project to a new device, run `playwright:init` to only install that.

Change the automatically created `playwright.config.ts` to the following:

```ts title=playwright.config.ts
import type { PlaywrightTestConfig } from "@playwright/test"
import { devices } from "@playwright/test"

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  testDir: `./e2e`,
  timeout: 30 * 1000,
  expect: {
    timeout: 5000,
  },
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  reporter: `list`,
  webServer: {
    command: `yarn serve`,
    port: 9000,
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
  use: {
    actionTimeout: 0,
    trace: `on-first-retry`,
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: `chromium`,
      use: {
        ...devices[`Desktop Chrome`],
      },
    },
  ],
}

export default config
```

Delete `tests-examples` folder and delete the `example.spec.ts` in `e2e` folder. Create a new file called `meta.spec.ts` inside `e2e`:

```ts title=e2e/meta.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test"

const siteTitle = `Testing Gatsby Head API`

test.describe(`Index Page`, () => {
  test(`should have correct meta tags`, async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto(`/`)

    await expect(page).toHaveTitle(siteTitle)

    const twitterTitle = await page
      .locator(`meta[name="twitter:title"]`)
      .getAttribute(`content`)
    const ogTitle = await page
      .locator(`meta[property="og:title"]`)
      .getAttribute(`content`)

    await expect(twitterTitle).toBe(siteTitle)
    await expect(ogTitle).toBe(siteTitle)
  })
})
```

Assuming you have a Head export in your `src/pages/index.tsx` like this your meta tags should be all set up:

```tsx
export const Head = () => <SEO />
```

Build your Gatsby site:

```sh
npm run build
```

You now can run Playwright:

```sh
npm run playwright
```
