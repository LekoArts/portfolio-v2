[tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) is a popular bundler powered by [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild). You can bundle, transform, and minify JavaScript and TypeScript with it.

One common problem I ran into was that I needed to exclude files from the build output, namely test files. Because my Jest/Vitest files are most often inside a `__tests__` folder inside `src` or alongside the source files with a postfix of `<filename>.test.<ext>`.

You can use the CLI to give tsup its inputs:

```shell
tsup src
```

This would build all files inside the `src` directory. In a configuration file it would look like this:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'tsup'

export default defineConfig({
  entry: ['src'],
})
```

tsup uses [globby](https://www.npmjs.com/package/globby) under the hood for its pattern matching inside `entry` so you can also use `!` to notate a negative pattern.

To exclude files inside `__tests__` or `<filename>.test.<ext>` files, you can modify the `entry` to this:

```ts highlight=4
import { defineConfig } from 'tsup'

export default defineConfig({
  entry: ['src', '!src/**/__tests__/**', '!src/**/*.test.*'],
})
```

Feel free to use a less verbose configuration (since you can combine this logic into one pattern) and test it with e.g. [globster.xyz](https://globster.xyz/).
